This will be my first post as announcement to my new blog page hosted through Github Pages.

This blog will be my attempt to share my knowledge and experiences throughout my career.
The main focus will be on building "things" through experimenting as this is what I do
most of the times since it's in my nature to be hands-on person while also curious "how things work".

In terms of frequency that I'll make new post won't be that high, but it will depend.
My target would make one post per month.
